### An example implementation of a foreach loop to sum 
### all the elements of a dictionary (or one-dimensional tensor) 
### using the dictionary (list) expansion operator:

summa := 0;
dictionary := (1,2,3,4,5,);
@while( dictionary ) {
    # The first dictionary element is moved to the item
    # and removed from the dictionary
    item, dictionary := ... dictionary; 
    summa += item;
};

# Last expression as return statement
summa
