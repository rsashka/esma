- Operators are separated by a semicolon ";".
- Indentations and line breaks are ignored.
- Single-line comments start with the symbol "#" until the end of the line, following the style of Python and Bash comments.
- Multi-line comments follow the C/C++ style and should be enclosed between "/\*" and "\*/". Multi-line comments can be *nested*.
- Command sequences [(code block)](/docs/ops/block/) are enclosed in curly braces "**{**" and "**}**".
- Most operators are expressions and return the result of the last operation.
